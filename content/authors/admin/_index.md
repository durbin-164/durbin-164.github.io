Hello everyone, I am a database graduate student who has been practicing for two and a half years. I have published papers and practiced in large companies. Now I am traveling in the academic ocean.

If someone offered me a good salary to do database research I would certainly do it, but if it was something unrelated to query optimization, I would probably turn it down. I am a person who loves knowledge and advocates freedom. I am very glad that you can see my home page. I hope we can get to know each other.

You are welcome to contact me to brainstorm and grow happily together.
